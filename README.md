# Barebones Currency Converter
## How it works
The user inputs the currencies they would like to convert from and to as well as the amount of money they would like to convert. As of now, only GBP and USD are compatible, but more will be added in the future.
## How to run it
It's literally just a .exe file, this will probably change in the future but for now it's just double click a file, not that hard.
## Why to use it
I don't know, you want to? It's a little crappy program coded by someone who has only been coding in C for like 3 weeks. It's entirely your choice if you want to some other guy's program who has a whole team and a huge budget dedicated to it, or just use google.
## Updates
This project gets daily updates, so your ideas will (probably) be seen, and if they're not stupid I might implement them, no promises, but then again who is even reading this right now? Reader, I am in your basement, please let me out, it's cold and dark, i'm hungry.
